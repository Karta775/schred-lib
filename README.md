# schred

schred is a Rust library & binary implementation of the [GNU shred](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/shred-invocation.html) utility. For now the goal is to have a super-set of the GNU shred features, and the schred library crate will eventually be used to write a secure, extensible cache cleaner.
